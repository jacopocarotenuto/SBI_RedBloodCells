# Simulation Based Inference
## LCPb Final Project
This repository contains the materials about the final project of the "Laboratory of Computational Physics (MOD. B)" course in the "Physics of Data" master program, University of Padova. </br>
The project aims to explore the Simulation Based Inference to study three stochastic models: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Run&Tumble, and a dynamical model of the Blood Cells motion. SBI is a powerful and promising tool to infere the posterior pdf of some parameters directly from the simulations (or from some summary statistics of them), in a likelihood-free context.

## About this repository
This GitHub repo is organized into two (plus one hidden) folders. Each folder has its own ```README``` with a brief description of the content of the files in it. The main folders are: </br>
1. ```Code``` contains both the Python pipelines and the analysis of the work done. You can find the results reached for each model and how we obtained them. </br>
2. ```InternalLibrary``` is the custom-made library we developed to make the pipelines coherent, optimized, and easier to read. This is mostly useful for the Blood Cells model, but some helper functions could be used also in other contexts. </br>
3. ```Data``` (hidden by the ```.gitignore```) is supposed to be organized into two subfolders: ```Simulations``` and ```SummaryStatistics```, containing the data about the Blood Cells model. Typically, we organized our data in batches (files .pkl) of 200 simulations each, divided by the day we did the simulations. The pipeline produces also a file ```done.txt``` with the list of the simulations already processed to obtain the set of summary statistics. </br>
